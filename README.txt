The input is a single number: the number at which the game starts. Write a program that plays the Threes game, 
and outputs a valid sequence of steps you need to take to get to 1. Each step should be output as the number 
you start at, followed by either -1 or 1 (if you are adding/subtracting 1 before dividing), or 0 
(if you are just dividing). The last line should simply be 1.

Notes: Easy challenge that took about 2 minutes, but good for a slight warmup.
